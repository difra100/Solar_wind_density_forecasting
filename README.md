# A CNN-LSTM framework for the solar wind density forecasting
This is the repository for the master's degree course in  **AI FOR VISUAL PERCEPTION IN HCI**, held by Professor Christian Napoli in La Sapienza.

## Project Description
In this project, we aim to develop a CNN-LSTM architecture to perform a time series analysis of sequential sun images, with the purpose of predicting in advance the solar wind particles' density (electrons + protons), nearby the Earth. Anticipating such phenomenon, mostly when the particles results in high number, is helpful for satellites and their electronic devices, since their correct working is highly affected by these.  
We start from the latest research results in the solar wind prediction field, that considered so far the only solar wind speed. Then, it's in our interest to develop a framework for the solar wind density forecasting (anticipating it 2 days earlier). After the prediction, it would be interesting to implement methods that are able to assess the dangerousness of an incoming flux.
